> He was a good listener and slow to take offense—both excellent and necessary qualities in a high school principal, though they failed to gain him acceptance with the majority, who had determined he was an asshole even before he arrived. — Location: [4242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N9BP4IG&location=4242) ^ref-36660

> One of the odd things about middle age, he concluded, was the strange decisions a man discovers he’s made by not really making them, like allowing friends to drift away through simple neglect. — Location: [4676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N9BP4IG&location=4676) ^ref-9390

> After all, what was the whole wide world but a place for people to yearn for their hearts’ impossible desires, for those desires to become entrenched in defiance of logic, plausibility, and even the passage of time, as eternal as polished marble? — Location: [5299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N9BP4IG&location=5299) ^ref-51790

> Mrs. Whiting remained undaunted for the simple reason that she never, ever allowed herself to dwell on the magnitude of whatever task she was confronted with. What she possessed was the marvelous ability to divide the chore into smaller, more manageable tasks. Once this diminishment was accomplished, her will became positively tidal in its persistence. Each day Mrs. Whiting had a “To Do” list, and the brilliance of that list lay in the fact that she was careful never to include anything undoable. — Location: [6263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N9BP4IG&location=6263) ^ref-47238

> Just because things happen slow doesn’t mean you’ll be ready for them. If they happened fast, you’d be alert for all kinds of suddenness, aware that speed was trump. “Slow” works on an altogether different principle, on the deceptive impression that there’s plenty of time to prepare, which conceals the central fact, that no matter how slow things go, you’ll always be slower. — Location: [7875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N9BP4IG&location=7875) ^ref-62213
