## Litmaps

20% off with : **EFFORTLESSACADEMIC**

**One of my favourite tools when it comes to conducting a Literature Review.**

**What I love about it:** It displays papers in a graph. X axis: Date. Y axis: Citations. Because older papers get cited more I usually have a correlation and papers tend to be sitting close to a diagonal.

But look right and up from the diagonal and you will immediately DISCOVER the papers that have many citations AND are recent.

Litmaps is a stellar tool to find [gaps in the literature](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1636546398270238720) and the central tool in my [Literature Review Course](https://effortlessacademic.com/lit-review/).

## Scite.ai

30% off with : **EFFORTLESSACADEMIC**

**Analyze how publications relate to each other.**

Scite allows you to break down citations into 3 categories:

* **Supporting**: If another paper validates the findings.
* **Contrasting**: If another paper refutes/cotnradicts the findings.
* **Mentioning**: e.g. as part of the introduction.

This allows you to identify controversial papers and quickly understand how the fit into the field.

[Scite Assistant](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1643204486905602049) on the other hand is like a ChatGPT for academics.
