###  Omnivore is a read-it-later app that lets you save and organize everything you read online. 

 This guide will show you how to use Omnivore’s basic functions and advanced features, divided into four main activities: 

* Saving
* Reading
* Organizing
* Integrations

The **Library** is the center of your Omnivore experience, where you can quickly access any links you have saved. Saved links remain in your Library forever unless you delete them. 

 There are five ways to save links to pages or articles that you wish to read later: 

* Saving from Your Omnivore Library
* Saving from a Browser
* Saving from a Phone or Tablet (iOS or Android)
* Newsletter Subscriptions via Email
* Saving PDFs from a Mac

###  Saving from Your Omnivore Library 

1\. In the upper right corner of your Library, tap the **Add Link** button.  
2\. Enter the URL you wish to save and tap **Add Link**.  
3\. The link will appear in your Library the next time you refresh it.  

###  Saving from a Browser 

 1\. Download and install the Omnivore extension for your browser: 

* [Chrome ](https://omnivore.app/install/chrome)
* [Edge](https://omnivore.app/install/edge)
* [Firefox](https://omnivore.app/install/firefox)
* [Safari](https://omnivore.app/install/safari)

2\. Navigate to the page you wish to save and tap the Omnivore button in your browser’s toolbar or Extensions menu.  
3\. Alternatively, you can right-click (command+click on Mac) on any hyperlink and select **Save to Omnivore** from the menu.  
4\. The link will appear in your Library the next time you refresh it.  

###  Saving from a Phone or Tablet 

 The best way to save links from your mobile device is via the Omnivore app. You can download the app here:

4\. Navigate to the signup page for the newsletter you wish to subscribe to.  
5\. Paste the Omnivore email address into the signup form. 

 6\. New newsletters will be automatically delivered to your Omnivore inbox.

##  Reading

 While reading, you can: 

* Change Formatting
* Highlight Text
* Add Notes
* View All Saved Highlights and Notes
* Track Reading Progress

2. Tap the **Note** button, type your note, and tap **Save**.
3. The Note icon will appear next time you view this article.

###  View All Saved Highlights and Notes 

1. Tap the Highlight/Note icon to see a list of all the highlighted text and notes you have added to this page.
2. To remove a note or highlight, select it from the list and tap the Trash icon.

###  Track Reading Progress 

 Omnivore automatically keeps track of your reading progress across your different devices so you can easily pick up where you left off. A progress bar will appear at the top of each link in your Library after you have started reading. 

##  Organizing 

 By default, the Library inbox displays all links you have saved. To manage your list and keep your reading organized, Omnivore provides the following actions: 

* Archiving
* Labels
* Search
* Filters

##  Archiving 

1. Tap the Menu icon next to the link you wish to archive (on the mobile app, long press the link to open the menu).
2. Select **Archive**.
3. The link will disappear from the default Library view, but will show up if you select the Archived filter (see Filters below).

### **Labels** 

1. Tap the Menu icon next to any link and select **Set Label**s.
2. Select an existing label from the list or tap **Edit Labels** to create a new one.
3. The label will appear next to the link in your Library. Tap it to view all links with the same label.
4. _Omnivore mobile app only_: tap **Labels** to see a complete list of all labels you have used; tap one to view all links with the same label
5. Note: Omnivore will automatically assign some labels, such as “Newsletters.”

###  Search 

1. To search through all your saved links, enter a keyword or phrase in the search bar.
2. You can combine keywords with labels and filters to focus your search even further. [Learn more about advanced search](https://docs.omnivore.app/using/search.html).

###  Filters 

1. Use the **Filters** menu to refine your Library view (some filters may be visible by default).
2. Select **Read Later** to view a list of all your non-archived links except Newsletters.
3. Select **Highlights** to view the text selections you have highlighted in all your saved pages.
4. Select **Today** to view a list of links you saved today.
5. Select **Newsletters** to view links saved via your newsletter subscriptions.

##  Integrations 

 Omnivore allows integrations with knowledge bases and note-taking apps including: 

* Logseq
* Webhooks

###  Logseq 

With Omnivore's Logseq plugin you can sync all your saved articles, highlights, and notes into Logseq, a popular knowledge base. For information on setting up and using the Logseq plugin, please refer to this helpful [Omnivore for Logseq Plugin Guide](https://briansunter.com/graph/#/page/omnivore-logseq-guide). 

###  Webhooks 

Omnivore can trigger webhooks when you save a link or add highlights to a page you are reading. [This example](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/syncing-all-your-notes-to-google) shows webhooks being used to write all saved links to a Google Sheets spreadsheet stored on a Google Drive.
