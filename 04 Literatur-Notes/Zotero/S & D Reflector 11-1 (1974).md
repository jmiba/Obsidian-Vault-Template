## Fakten

> THE HULL is 321 feet long, 50 feet beam, 91 feet wide over all, 11 1/2 feet hold amidship, and 17 1/2 feet at the bow and stern; floor timbers 11 inches deep,  4 1/2 and 5 inches thick, plac ed 12, 13 and 14 inches apart from center to center; main kelson 11 x 18 inches fore and aft; bulkhead of 2 1/2 inches in poplar, doubled; knuckle kelson 9 x 18 inches; clamp, 4 x 15 and 3 1/2 x 15 inches, with nine floor and side strakes on each side, ranging in size from 71/2 x 11 inches to 4 x 10 inches; her bottom plank and up and around the knuckle to light water are 4 1/2 inches thick and the bend 3 1/2 inches. To support the weight of her ten immense boilers there are eight arches in the hold of heavy timber running fore and aft, well bolted and fastened; so there is no possibility of the hull sagg ing under the boilers--a new feature in equalizing the weight, and pronounced by experts complete. All through the hold, in fact, great ingenuity is displayed in arranging of chains, braces, bulk heads and stanchions so as to meet the strain of a load of cotton, and yet utilize all the space for the stowage of cotton bales.

> The skylight is very chaste in drawing and execution, one of the main features being the statuary and antique busts in the center of each light. The statues are painted in pearly gray on a blue ground inclosed by a wreath of ivy in gray on a white ground, the whole light surrounded by a border in purple and gold. The busts are on a pink ground, inclosed with laurel, the border blue and gold .
