> This is the monument erected at the grave of Capt. J.M. White, photographed last fall by C. W. Stoll . It stands on a b luff overlooking the Ohio River at Cloverport, Ky. The twin columns according to local legend simulate steamboat smokestacks . The story of a visit to the cemetery appeared in our last issue . The superlative side- wheel J.M. WHITE built in 1878 honored the name of Captain White.

> The Chickering grand piano used on the J.M. WHITE still exists. This revealment comes to us in a letter from Howard B. Peabody of Natchez. He says: "Our daughter married a grandson or great grand­son of Capt. John W. Tobin, Esmond Phelps II of New Orleans. She now tells me that the family owns the Chickering grand piano from the J. M. WHITE described in the March '74 issue of S&D REFLECTOR, page 35. It has a keyboard of ivory and mother-of-pearl. I have not seen it, but doubtlessly it has had good care over the years as the Tobin familX relatives appre­ciate its worth.' This piano was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition, Philadel­phia, in 1876 where it won "a flattering testimonial besides the prize medal." Let us here raise the editorial eyebrow to remark that we have seen (and in several instances have sat upon) cabin chair used on the J.M. WHITE, notably in St. Louis, Little Rock, Tell City, and New Orleans. There remains hardly any doubt but that the boat was stripped of her finer fittings prior to the fire which destroyed her. We grant the plausibility of the removal of chairs, but that the grand piano was lugged ashore at New Orleans whets our curiosity as to WHY she was stripped.
