> J . M. WHITE I N THE SMITHSONIAN First time you are in Washington, D,C. visit the rotunda of the Smithsonian ' s Museum of History and Technol ogy and see the famous model of the J.M . WHITE .  John L. Fryant took this picture and the lady at the left is his wife Sharon: This.model made its debut at the 1972 S&D meeting, Marietta, displayed by its builders John H. Leslie and Ralph C. Hitchcock. On that occasion the model paddled under its own steam in the reflection pool of the Ohio River Museum guided  by remote control .  Re cently John Leslie presented the model, built at a cost of more than $50 ,000 , to the Smithsonian.

> What in trigued us most was a fascinating model side-wheeler of the cotton style--something like the J. M. WHITE but not--which was built with a wood hull and soldered tin upper works at the Howard Yard in Jeffersonville, 1878. It rode in state to New Orleans aboard the J. M. WHITE on her maiden voyage. Tradition says it was built as a toy for Captain Tobin's son--and quite some toy if so. This trinket has survived nearly a century without benefit of paint or repair, and is a bit battered, but mark this, you model builders, the gentleman who built it (his name not known) had solved the problem of how to manufacture miniature steamboat railing with all of the palings, and he did the job in tin what's more.

> X MOST UNUSUAL VIEW of the Green- Barren river packet CHAPERON (left) moored along- side the new excursion steamer IDLEWILD taken at the mouth of Green River, Ky. in early 1915. The IDLEWILD was bound to Mem- phis having recently been completed at the James Rees & Sons shop, Pittsburgh. Both are cooled down, cleaning boilers. The stages are up to discourage natives from boarding. The photo was taken by John L. Fryant who handed it to us last Nov. 12th when he was visiting at 121 River. Enough fooling around now; these are scale models . John built both of them. If these two boats had managed to get side by side in 1915 the scene would have looked precisely as you see it here.
